Oracle Brute Force Tool

I've always had issues running brute force for Oracle default accounts. This is just a quick script to address some of the things that other tools missed:

  specify port
  specify IP or DNS
  username/password bruting, or just username with a password list
  multi threaded
  don't have to install the fucking OCI client and fanny around with gems (ahem, metasploit)
  problems with nmap scripts
  service or SID
